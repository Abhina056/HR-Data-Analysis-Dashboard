# HR-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

## Project Overview

AtliQ Technologies, a software company, is seeking a Data Analytics Dashboard for HR analysis within the organization. The primary objective of this analysis is to track metrics such as WFH% (Work from Home), Leave%, and Sick Leave% to facilitate informed decision-making regarding meeting scheduling, functions, and other operational aspects. The insights derived from this Dashboard can aid in strategic planning, including release scheduling. Additionally, monitoring employees' WFH% can assist in optimizing working hours, space utilization, and cost savings on rent. We have been provided with three months' worth of attendance data for analysis.
